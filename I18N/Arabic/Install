The following requirements should be met prior to using Arabic library:
* PHP version 5.0 or higher


Installation instructions
-------------------------

Installation is quite easy: copy the contents of the "Arabic" folder and "Arabic.php"
file to any location in your application required.

Afterwards, make sure you can include "Arabic.php" file. This can be achieved by
respecting a base folder structure, or by setting the PHP include path, for example:

set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . '/path/to/Arabic.php/');
